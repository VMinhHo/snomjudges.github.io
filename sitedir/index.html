<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana"> "This movie cured my cancer, brought my dog back and added $500 to my bank account. All in all, it was a mid experience. 6/10"</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> -Martin Scorsese </p>
<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana"> "Definitely one of the movies of all time. The actors performed their roles and the plot progressed until the end. The setting was definitely an environment for the characters. 5/10" </p>
<p style = "font-family:verdana"> -Steven Spielberg </p>
<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana"> "One guy booed at the end so Tom Cruise came in the theater and beat the life out of him. 10/10" <p>
<p style ="font-family:verdana"> -Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson </p>
<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana"> "I booed at the end of the movie and woke up in the ER 4 hours later. 9/10" <p>
<p style ="font-family:verdana"> -Mahatma Gandhi </p>
<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana"> "Such a disappointing sequel. The characters were totally unrealistic and the "action" had me almost falling asleep. There was far too much vulgar language to call it a PG movie. All in all, Peppa Pig: The Movie was a 4/10." </p>
<p style ="font-family:verdana"> -Stephen King </p>
