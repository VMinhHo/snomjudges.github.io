<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana";"width: 50%;"> "This movie cured my cancer, brought my dog back and added $500 to my bank account. All in all, it was a mid experience. 6/10"</p>
<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana";"width: 50%;"> -Martin Scorsese </p>
<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana";"width: 50%;"> "Definitely one of the movies of all time. The actors performed their roles and the plot progressed until the end. The setting was definitely an environment for the characters. 5/10" </p>

<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana";"width: 50%;"> "One guy booed at the end so Tom Cruise came in the theater and beat the life out of him. 10/10" </p>

<p class = "review", style ="font-family:verdana";"width: 50%;"> -Mahatma Gandhi </p>
<p class = "review", style="font-family:verdana";"width: 50%;"> "Such a disappointing sequel. The characters were totally unrealistic and the "action" had me almost falling asleep. There was far too much vulgar language to call it a PG movie. All in all, Peppa Pig: The Movie was a 4/10." </p>
